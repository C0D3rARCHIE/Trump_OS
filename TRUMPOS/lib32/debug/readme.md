TO ALL USERS OF BKDM OS, PLEASE LISTEN CAREFULLY ABOUT THE USE OF DEBUG MODE.

DEBUG MODE IS A POWERFUL TOOL FOR THE DEVELOPERS OF THIS OPERATING SYSTEM TO SEE VALUES OF VARIABLES, LOCATION OF METHODS AND INVOKE ERRORS OR INSTRUCTIONS.

DEBUG MODE IS ACTIVATED BY ENTERING THE DEBUG COMMAND INTO THE COMMAND LINE WHEN IN RING/PRIVELEGE LEVEL 0; THEREFORE IT IS INACCESSIBLE TO ANYONE BESIDES A DEVELOPER, WHO HAS A COMPILED SHELL LOADED IN PL0.

THE COMMAND ACTIVATES A ROUTINE THAT CHECKS IF THE KEYWORD, CHANGED WITH EVERY BUILD, IS PRESENT ONE CHARACTER OF OFFSET AFTER THE DEBUG COMMAND.

THE DEBUG COMMAND IS LOCATED AT INDEX 2 OF THE COMMAND_METHOD ARRAY AND TAKES THE SAME ARGUMENTS AS ALL OTHER COMMANDS.

IT IS HIGHLY RECOMMENDED THAT ONLY THOSE WHO HAVE EXPERIENCE WITH THE API OR THE OPERATING SYSTEM USE OR INVOKE THIS COMMAND AT ANY TIME.

DAMAGE MAY BE CAUSED TO HARD DISKS OR HARDWARE ATTACHED TO YOUR BOOTING DEVICE/COMPUTER IF DEBUG MODE IS ENTERED ON THAT DEVICE/COMPUTER.

WE ARE NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR THIS DAMAGE NOR FOR THE MISUSE OF THE OPERATING SYSTEM AT ALL.
